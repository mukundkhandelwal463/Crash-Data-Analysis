# Crash-Data-Analysis
🚗 Crash Data Analysis using Python & EDA

This project is a detailed analysis of a real-world crash dataset using Python, with a strong focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and statistical insights. The goal is to extract patterns, trends, and risk factors to improve road safety and support data-driven decision-making.

📌 Project Objectives
Identify peak accident times and days

Study injury severity and its influencing factors

Analyze the effect of weather, road, and light conditions

Evaluate the impact of alcohol and drug use

Detect frequent traffic violations and collision types

Perform outlier detection using IQR and Z-score methods

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

pandas, numpy – data wrangling

seaborn, matplotlib – data visualization

scipy.stats.zscore – statistical outlier detection

📊 Key Visualizations

Correlation Heatmap – Relationship between numeric variables

Monthly Crash Frequency – Trend across months

Crash Severity Distribution – Impact-based crash breakdown

Environmental Impact Charts – Crash severity by weather, light, and surface

Substance Influence – Severity vs. alcohol/drug use

Traffic Violations & Collision Types – Most frequent causes and impact

Boxplot & Z-score Analysis – Outlier detection

📈 Outcomes

Most crashes occurred during clear daylight and high-traffic hours

Alcohol-related crashes were linked to higher injury severity

3,249 outliers detected using the Z-score method

Generated 12+ graphs for detailed insights

💡 Why This Project Matters

Understanding crash patterns helps:

Save lives with better traffic planning

Target high-risk behaviors like substance use or speeding

Support policy-making and infrastructure improvement
